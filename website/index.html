            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
                We are team #4 "Dream Team", Andres, Adrain, Lazaro, Gabriel, and Carlos, and we worked on this project during the 2024 Fall semester. Our project is titled "Falcon Wing Sustainability". The problem we aim to address is giving injured falcons with amputated wings or injured wings the chance to fly again, allowing them to contribute to the ecosystem and live a full life. Our design features a prosthetic wing that attaches to the wing bone and is secured with a body belt that wraps around the bird for added stability. We hope you find this project as interesting as we did.

            <h2>What is the Problem?</h2>
            <p>
                Falcons with injured or amputated wings face numerous challenges. Flight is essential for their ability to forage, escape predators, and migrate. Rehabilitation centers often face difficulty in treating these injuries effectively, as traditional methods like splints or bandages can provide temporary relief but fail to restore a falcon's ability to fly. Without the ability to regain flight, falcons lose their autonomy and their role in the ecosystem, which is crucial for maintaining balance in nature.
                Additionally, many existing prosthetic designs are either too heavy, which can hinder the falcon's ability to take flight, or fail to mimic the natural movement of a falcon’s wing. These limitations make them impractical for long-term use, leaving rehabilitators with limited options. In many cases, falcons are unable to return to the wild and are forced into permanent captivity or, in the worst cases, are euthanized due to the lack of feasible solutions. This highlights the urgent need for a prosthetic that is lightweight, flexible, and capable of supporting the bird’s natural flight mechanics. Our project seeks to bridge this gap by developing a prosthetic that provides both functional support and restores the falcon's ability to thrive in its natural environment.

        <section id="important-info">
            <h2>Important to Know</h2>
            <p>
                Our project draws upon extensive research into falcon anatomy and 3D printing technologies. For the prosthetic wing, we utilized PLA Aero, a lightweight and aerodynamically efficient material specifically designed for applications like this. PLA Aero is ideal for creating a durable yet lightweight wing structure that mimics the natural dynamics of a falcon's wing. This material's strength-to-weight ratio ensures that the prosthetic provides the necessary support while allowing for the flexibility required in flight. Additionally, PLA Aero is biocompatible, which ensures the comfort and safety of the falcon.
                To design the prosthetic, we used CAD software, which allowed us to create highly detailed and precise models of the falcon's wing and the prosthetic structure. CAD enabled us to test different designs virtually, refine the dimensions for a proper fit, and simulate how the prosthetic would interact with the falcon’s body. This 3D modeling process was essential in ensuring the prosthetic would be both functional and comfortable for the bird. Through consultation with veterinarians and rehabilitation experts, we identified key criteria, including ease of attachment, flexibility, and durability.

            <h2>Why is this Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Falcons play a critical role in maintaining ecological balance. They help with pest control, regulate the populations of small mammals and other prey species, and contribute to the overall health of ecosystems by maintaining food web dynamics. Their hunting habits also help control the spread of diseases, making them key players in preserving the natural equilibrium. When a falcon loses its ability to fly, it not only impacts the falcon’s life but also disrupts these vital ecological processes, potentially leading to an imbalance in local ecosystems.
                The inability of falcons to perform their natural roles can have far-reaching consequences, affecting prey species and other predators, thus cascading through the ecosystem. Rehabilitation centers often face both ethical and practical challenges in dealing with injured falcons, especially when traditional treatments fail to restore the falcon’s independence. The loss of a falcon's ability to fly can lead to long-term captivity, where they may lose their natural instincts and struggle to adapt. By providing a reliable prosthetic solution, we can empower these centers to enhance the quality of life for these animals. This not only aids in their rehabilitation and potential reintroduction into the wild but also plays a significant role in preserving biodiversity. Our project contributes to conservation efforts by helping these birds return to their natural habitat, where they can continue fulfilling their ecological roles.

        <section id="solution">
            <h2>Our Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p>
                Our prosthetic falcon wing is designed to restore flight capabilities in injured falcons. It is made from lightweight, 3D-printed PLA Aero material, which closely mimics the structure and functionality of a natural wing. The prosthetic is designed for easy attachment and detachment, ensuring it can be adjusted as the falcon grows or recovers. We also incorporated flexible joints and simulated feather structures to replicate the aerodynamics of a real wing. This ensures that the prosthetic not only looks realistic but also performs effectively during flight, taking advantage of the aerodynamics provided by PLA Aero.

            <h2>From Idea to Reality</h2>
            <p>
                Transforming this concept into a reality required a multi-disciplinary approach. Starting with brainstorming sessions, we sketched preliminary designs and modeled them using CAD software. Prototypes were created using various materials, including PLA Aero, to test for strength, flexibility, and comfort. Feedback from wildlife experts and rehabilitators played a crucial role in refining the design to ensure practicality and safety.

            <h2>Prototype Early and Often</h2>
            <p>
                Early prototyping helped us test and identify potential issues with our design. Initial prototypes focused on the basic shape and attachment mechanism. Subsequent iterations improved upon weight distribution, durability, and aerodynamics. Testing the prototypes on falcon models provided valuable insights into how the prosthetic would perform under real-world conditions. These early trials were instrumental in perfecting the final product.

            <h2>Final Product</h2>
            <p>
                Our final prosthetic falcon wing combines cutting-edge 3D printing technology with a deep understanding of falcon anatomy. The product is durable, lightweight, and designed to mimic the natural movement of a falcon’s
                wing. It features adjustable straps for secure attachment and a feather-like structure for optimal aerodynamics. Initial tests have shown that falcons equipped with this prosthetic can regain a significant degree of flight ability, making this a groundbreaking solution for falcon rehabilitation.

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>
                While our current design has shown promising results, there is room for further improvement. Future work will focus on testing the prosthetic across a wider range of falcon species, incorporating feedback to refine the design further. Additionally, we aim to explore the use of biodegradable materials to enhance the sustainability of the product. Collaborations with wildlife rehabilitation centers will also be essential in implementing the prosthetic at scale and training staff to use it effectively.
